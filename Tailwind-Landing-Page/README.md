# Project Title

This repository contains the code for my Assignment 1 for the FSWD-10423-DevTown-Course. The assignment was to create a landing page using Tailwind CSS.

The page is a simple landing page with a header, a section for the main content, and a footer. The main content section contains a brief introduction to the course, as well as a link to the course website.

The page is styled using Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-based CSS framework that allows you to quickly and easily style your web pages.

To view the page, clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
